# Radiance
A Computer Graphics Study

This repository will contain OpenGL 4.5 implementations of some computer graphics algorithms I'll be studying.
I intend to organize each algorithm/technique in its own folder.

### Dependencies:
Since the objective is to learn rendering techniques, I'll be using some libraries for the setup code.

* GLFW (for operating system interfacing) &#8594; https://glfw.org/
* GLAD (for loading OpenGL functions) &#8594; https://glad.dav1d.de/
* Dear ImGui (for user interface) &#8594; https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
* stb (for loading image files) &#8594; https://github.com/nothings/stb

Make sure to clone the repository with --recursive to include all submodules.

E.g.: git clone --recursive https://github.com/marcelodmmenezes/Radiance.git
